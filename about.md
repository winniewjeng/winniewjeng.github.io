Tell me a story<br>
<br>
In this century, and moment, of mania<br>
Tell me a story<br>
<br>
Make it a story of great distances and starlight<br>
<br>
The name of the story will be Time<br>
But you must not pronounce its name<br>
<br>
Tell me a story of deep delight<br>
<br>

Thank you for visiting! I love literature, computer science, and astrophysics.

On this site, you will find mostly class notes blended in with some fanciful musings and personal projects.

Tell me a story.<br>
<br>
In this century, and moment, of mania,<br>
Tell me a story.<br>
<br>
Make it a story of great distances, and starlight.<br>
<br>
The name of the story will be Time,<br>
But you must not pronounce its name.<br>
<br>
Tell me a story of deep delight.<br>
<br><br>

I love computer science, literature, and astrophysics.

On this site, you will find mostly class notes mixed in with some random personal musings.

Thank you for visiting!

title: Binary Search Trees
category: Data Structure and Algorithm

Searching is the most fundamental operation in a tree. Every information retrieval or modification done to a tree begins with searching. Without the ability to consistently search a tree, it is impossible to perform any operation on a tree.

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is the tree structure built for the feature of data searching. An internal <em>full</em> node (with two children) of a BST stores data of smaller value in its left child node and data of greater value in its right child node. BST does not allow nodes with the same data value--each node must has distinct data value.

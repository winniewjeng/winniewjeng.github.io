There are two kinds of logic structures--combinational and sequential. Combinational logic structures are decision elements that output based on the current inputs. Unlike the sequential logic circuits, they do not have the storage ability. 

This post examines the four most common combinational logic circuits: decoder, mux, one-bit adder, and programmable logic array.

### 1. Decoder
A property of the decoder is that exactly one of its output is <tt>1</tt>, and the rest of the outputs are <tt>0</tt>'s. 

A decoder with $$n$$ inputs has $$2^n$$ outputs.

<b>Figure 1</b> shows a 3-bit decoder.

### 3. One-Bit Adder (Full Adder)

### 4. The Programmable Logic Array (PLA)
